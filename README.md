### Project Currently Under Development 
# MentalHealthChatbot

### Objective

- A person going through a mental crisis or depression significantly requires someone to listen and talk to them. In order to save someone from diving deep into depression, communicating with them is the most important step. Depression deteriorates basic activities of daily living such as eating and bathing, so the only way to improve the condition is to encourage the person and converse with them. Thus, the primary objective of the project is to interact with a user going through any kind of mental stress or depression and motivate them to perform their daily activities without pessimistic thinking.

### Methodology
- Collected data from online sources and will be arranged in a simple and clean JSON structure.
- JSON structure will consist of different categories of questions and their corresponding answers.
- NLP will be performed on the structured data and the data will be converted into the bag of words format and will be passed to the neural network.
- Neural network will predict the category in which the particular set of words belong to.
- Based on the output category, an answer will be given to the user.
- Currently working on integrating this chatbot on Discord, so that it can be used as a Discord Bot
